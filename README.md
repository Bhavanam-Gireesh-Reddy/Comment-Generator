## Overview

üîß
Comment Generator is an intelligent developer tool crafted to automatically generate meaningful comments for code snippets. It streamlines the process of code documentation, making source files more readable and maintainable with the help of language models.

### Why Comment Generator?
This project addresses the often-overlooked need for quality code documentation by using AI to simplify and automate the commenting process. The core features include:

‚ú® Code Input Flexibility: Accepts raw code, file paths (.py, .ipynb), or direct prompts for comment generation.

üß† LLM-Powered Explanations: Leverages powerful language models (OpenAI GPT-4) to generate human-like and context-aware code comments.

üí° Interactive Prompting: Accepts real-time input, making it an excellent tool for exploratory use or batch processing.

üìÇ Multi-file Support: Designed to work with standalone files and interactive notebooks, enhancing productivity across workflows.

‚öôÔ∏è Plug & Play Interface: Easily integrated into developer tools or pipelines, helping teams maintain clean and understandable codebases.

üß™ Prototyping-Ready: The notebook format provides an interactive environment for experimentation and improvement.
